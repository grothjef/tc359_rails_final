== My Final

I chose to do:

* (1) Add search to your index action in Rails
	- there is a search bar above the heroes tables

* (1) Scrape data from another website with nokogiri
	- I scrape from dotabuff the heroes sorted by winrate

* (1) Gauging performance and identifying bottlenecks in Rails
	- implemented the lol_dba gem and the rack-mini-profiler gem
